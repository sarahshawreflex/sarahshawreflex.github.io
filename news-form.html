        <p class="lead center-text text-light">
        Come and try it for yourself in a very relaxed surrounding.
        <br>
        <br>
        For you first treatment I will need to spend about 90 minutes in order to establish your specific needs and to ask you about your past and present health and medical conditions.
        <br>
        <br>
        I will then begin to use my hands to apply pressure to your feet. Reflexology can discover subtle changes in specific areas of the feet which may correspond to the organs, glands and other areas of the body. The treatment usually lasts about an hour each time.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you have medical conditions you may be asked to obtain your GP's permission if you have diabetes and certain heart conditions or if you are currently receiving treatment for cancer. Although Reflexology is a perfectly  safe form of treatment is is still advisable for these conditions.  It is also advisable to wait till after the first three months of pregnancy before having treatments.

        <h1 class="center-text">After a Treatment</h1>
        <p class="lead center-text text-light">
        After your first treatment you may feel a sense of deep relaxation and well being. As your body starts to heal it may start detoxifying itself  which a positive sign. You will need to drink more water than usual to help the detoxifying process.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some chronic conditions can start to show good results after 4-6 treatments. Some of my clients like to come every so often for a general sense of well being and to maintain a healthy mind and body balance.

        <h1 class="center-text">My Experience</h1>
        <p class="lead center-text text-light">
          I trained as a Reflexologist in 1996 at The British School of Reflexology .  My tutor was Ann Gillanders who is the Principle and founder.  She was trained under the method of Eunice Ingham the founder of Modern reflexology. Ann and her brother Tony Porter were responsible for the recognition and developement of reflexology in England and continental Europe.  She has written many books on the subject, lectures extensively and has broadcasted both on the tv and radio.
        <br>
        <br>
        During my years as a reflexologist I have worked both from home and in Holistic Healing centres.  I have been able to gain a wealth of experience and knowledge during this time and thoroughly enjoy meeting and treating my clients.
        <br>
        <br>
        Please feel free to contact me if you have a questions or concerns about a reflexology treatment.</p>
